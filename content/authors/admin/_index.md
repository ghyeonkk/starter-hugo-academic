At present, I am pursuing a Ph.D. in computer science at Chung-Ang University, a member of the Vision and Learning Lab ([VLLAB](https://vllab.cau.ac.kr/)), advised by Prof. [Eunwoo Kim](https://vllab.cau.ac.kr/members/professor/). My research spans various fields, such as computer vision and video understanding. If you share similar research interests and are interested in collaborating, please feel free to contact me without hesitation.
